# MikuMusicSharp
C# overhauld of the music part of the Hatsune Miku Bot!

This is a super beta version that probably has bugs due to me not knowing how to use a sharded client correctly hehe

# What u need
(yes this has no license, but if you're smart u can use the one from the main bot)
- [DSharpPlus](https://github.com/DSharpPlus/DSharpPlus) (newest nightly build)
- [Lavalink 3](https://github.com/Frederikam/Lavalink)
*thants it lol*

I was too lazy to make it read Discord API key and Lavalink data from a json or something, so ya gotta add that yourself
and DBL API key if need (cant remember if i put that in atm)
